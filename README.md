Audiopilot
==========
An "active music listening game". It just takes an audio file as an argument (flac, ogg etc: anything handled by libsndfile) and lets you fly around a tunnel based on the audio, while the song is playing.

Here is a video of it in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDImm36ousc
